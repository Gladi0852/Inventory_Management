This Inventory Management Project is a React-based web application that enables users to manage inventory items by adding, updating, and deleting them. It features item details like name, category, quantity, and price, with filtering and sorting capabilities. The app highlights items with a quantity of less than 10, helping users track low-stock items. It also includes a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience. The project uses React Context and useReducer for state management, stores data in localStorage, and ensures input validation for smooth functionality.
